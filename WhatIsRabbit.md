# What is Rabbit? #
Rabbit is a MVC framework based on Java. We are always used to developing web application on Strtus, Spring MVC.... Do these framework really help you to save time of development? Do these framework really take easy for communication with UI designer? I think it's not really.

Why? because you spend too much time to focus on the flow control of the URL. and you have also to write Java code in the html. when you add the code into html, it will be nightmare for designer. it's too terrible, right?

So how should you do? Use Rabbit right now.
